  Peter - Backend

### Are you tired of being late?
### Wish you had a solution?
### Well I think we have the alarm clock for you.
## 
## 1 - Set your alarm, just like any other alarm clock. Sure, you can snooze - until you are late. Then your alarm clock starts to 'assist'
### you with your over sleeping problem. You get three strikes.
### Simply hit 'On time' when you arrive to work in the morning. Then you will stay in the alarms good graces... however if you are late - 
### the alarm clock starts getting proactive!
### 2 - 3 time late; disables snooze
### 3 - 5th time late; alarm clock starts making you get out of bed. And it wont stop until you reach the location (set by you) in the 
### residence. 
### Initial design - snooze button, set button, late button, on time button.
### Layout 1 - Buttons, one of which takes you to the alarm interface. (Realize we will need an additional layout for entering GPS 
### location(s) - if we use the work GPS.
### Critical path (for class) integration of GPS with in application. 
### Time permitting - maybe we also allow/force them to enter GPS (address of work) to keep them honest??
